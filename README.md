Download the .exe or build it yourself. On first boot, it will ask you what folder you want to save the file to.

You can write the project you are working on (It will link to it in Obsidian, or other markdown readers that use Wikilinks), start and stop the timer, and minimize/enlarge the window to go minimal or not.

If you are saving the file to your Obsidian Vault (Or other markdown reader) it will update live!
